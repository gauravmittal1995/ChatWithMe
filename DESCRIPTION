This app works like a combiation of skype and facebook chats. User registers, makes his profile, adds friends. There are two type of chats available:
1) Single User Chat - Private Chat
2) Multiple User Chat - Group Chat
THe whole UI is made in bootstrap so this app can also be run from mobile browsers.

The user has an option to change his profile information and password at any time. There is a search engine which can search for users by which a user can find and add friends.

There is an option of offline messaging which basically means that a user can leave message for his friends on their chat page and the second user recieves them as soon as he logs back in.
